```js
<SimpleLoadingSpinner />
```

```js
<SimpleLoadingSpinner size={75} />
```

```js
<SimpleLoadingSpinner color="green" />
```

Note that the `fullScreen` prop isn't shown because, well, it would cause the spinner to sit on top of everything.

Use it like this:
```jsx static
<SimpleLoadingSpinner fullScreen />
```
