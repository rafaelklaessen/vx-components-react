```js
<VxThemeProvider>
  This component sets the <Code>ThemeContext</Code> which is used by other components. Its use is not obligatory, but if you do use it, use it at the top level of your app.
  <br />
  <br />
  It also sets the <Code>font-family</Code> and <Code>font-size</Code>, thus rendering <Code>font.css</Code> useless.
</VxThemeProvider>
```
