```js
<VxThemeProvider>
  This component sets the ThemeContext which is used by other components. Its use is not obligatory, but if you do use it, use it at the top level of your app.
  <br />
  <br />
  It also sets the <code>font-family</code>, thus rendering <code>font.css</code> useless.
</VxThemeProvider>
